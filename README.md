\# User Activity Analytics (Python + SQL + Power BI)



This project analyzes event-level user login data to derive core product

engagement metrics and trends. The goal is to demonstrate practical analytics

skills across SQL, Power BI (DAX), and dashboard design.



\## Problem Statement

Given raw user login events, build meaningful metrics to understand

user activity, engagement, and retention over time.



\## Dataset

\- Event-level login data

\- One row per user per login date

\- Fields include user\_id, login\_date, platform, region



\## Metrics \& Analysis

\- Daily Active Users (DAU)

\- Weekly Active Users (WAU)

\- Monthly Active Users (MAU)

\- Retention cohorts (weekly)

\- User engagement patterns (login streaks)



\## Tech Stack

\- Python : Synthetic data generation

\- SQL: data exploration, aggregations, cohort logic

\- Power BI (DAX): time-based metrics, comparisons, and ratios

\- Power BI: interactive dashboards and slicing



\## Design Decisions

\- Event-level data modeled into analytical metrics

\- Metric computation split between SQL and Power BI for flexibility

\- Power BI used for rapid iteration and interactive analysis



\## Repository Structure

\- `/sql` – SQL queries for metric computation and analysis

\- `/powerbi` – Power BI dashboard file

\- `/data` – sample or mock data (if applicable)
